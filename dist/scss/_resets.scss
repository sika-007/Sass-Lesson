//PARTIALS
/*This current file is what is referred to as a partial. Partials arre modularized snippets of scss that can make the job of maintenance much easier.

Pay Attention to the file name. it begins with an underscore "_" This is how the sass compiler knows that it should not directly compile it into regular css> the underscore also lets it know that the file is a partial. let us write some code to demonstrate how partials work.*/
